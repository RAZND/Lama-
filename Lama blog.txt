I am a lovely lama and like to lick lemons.
For breakfast
For lunch
For a snack
But not for dinner
I eat limes for dinner.

But limes taste sour
It is what gives me strength
It is what gives me courage
To stand up to mankind
And spit in their face.



happy llama
sad llama
happy llama
sad llama
happy llama
evil llama

And sometimes lemons depending on my mood

I love to eat,
